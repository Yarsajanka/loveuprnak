# Instructions for Adding Audio File

To make this project fully functional, you need to add an actual audio file:

1. Create or download an audio file with "I love U" audio (MP3 or M4A format)
2. Rename the file to "love_sound.mp3" or "love_sound.m4a"
3. Place it in this directory (same folder as index.html)

## Creating the Audio File

Option 1: Record your own
- Use your computer's voice recorder or any recording software
- Record someone saying "I love U" clearly
- Save as MP3 or M4A format
- Rename to "love_sound.mp3" or "love_sound.m4a"

Option 2: Use text-to-speech
- Use online text-to-speech services
- Convert "I love U" to speech
- Download as MP3 or M4A
- Rename to "love_sound.mp3" or "love_sound.m4a"

Option 3: Download from royalty-free sources
- Find a suitable "I love you" audio clip
- Ensure it's legally usable
- Convert to MP3 or M4A if needed
- Rename to "love_sound.mp3" or "love_sound.m4a"

## Testing the Project

4. The audio should play at maximum volume
