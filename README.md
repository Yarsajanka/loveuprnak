# Cybersecurity Prank Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a web-based prank that attempts to:
1. Maximize device volume
2. Play an "I love U" sound when a link is clicked

## Educational Purpose
This project is for educational purposes to show:
- How websites can attempt to interact with device settings
- Browser security restrictions that protect users
- Why user interaction is often required for certain actions

## How It Works
1. User clicks the "Boost My Love Now!" link
2. JavaScript attempts to:
   - Set volume to maximum
   - Play the "I love U" sound

## Browser Security Limitations
Modern browsers have security features that prevent:
- Automatic volume changes without user permission
- Autoplaying audio without user interaction
- Direct control of device settings by websites

## Adding the Audio File
To make this project fully functional:
1. Replace `love_sound.mp3` with an actual MP3 file containing "I love U" audio
2. Ensure the audio file is in the same directory as `index.html`

## Ethical Considerations
This project is intended for educational purposes only. When used responsibly, it can help people understand:
- How seemingly harmless websites can attempt to manipulate device settings
- The importance of browser security features
- Why user permission is required for certain actions

## Disclaimer
This project does not actually restart devices or perform any harmful actions. It's designed to demonstrate concepts in cybersecurity education.
